Tasks:
	- Check wallpaper on main branch before publishing.
	- Make the pixelate effect optionally retain the original aspect ratio (black bars outside).

Bugs:
	- Scripts won't move lights outside of the editor.
	- Image layer scale is rounded to the nearest 0.001 when the scene is saved. Need more precision in 3D scenes where everything is 1/100 scale by default. Manually editing values to be lower works, but they get rounded after save/load.

Done

Bugs:
	- Click boxes for text layers are shifted to the left on the desktop if the canvas aspect ratio is higher than the screen aspect ratio.
	X (Not reliably reproducible) cursorMove gets called every frame outside of the editor, but only when the cursor moves inside the editor.


	- Delay showing 'press to start' until intro is completed.
		- Add a transform parenting system using matrix functions.
